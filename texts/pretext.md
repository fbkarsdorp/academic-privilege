# Before you start:

We would like to give you a clear idea how we use your data and how you can control it:

- You don't have to fill out the user account form completely. The only thing required is
  a username. This browser is your link to your data: here we will store the necessary references to your data on our server.
- You can stop and delete all your data at any time you want, as long as your profile is still active in your browser.
- When playing solo, none of your answers or profile data will be traceable to you for other users. Your answers to the questions will only be visible for others as part of the aggregated statistics.
- When playing in a group, only your **name** and your **privilege position** will be
  visible for other participants in the group. Your profile information will not be
  shared, neither will individual answers to the questions.

For more information, go back to **my profile** and check our **privacy notice**.
