The objective of this exercise is to help create awareness in relation to the varying degrees of privilege individuals enjoy.

This game is based on a board game, developed by Barbara Bordalejo (KU Leuven) and Daniel Paul O’Donnell (University of Lethbridge) to illustrate privilege during workshops about diversity awareness.

The initial inspiration for the game came from a video which illustrated privilege in a visual form ([youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD5f8GuNuGQ)). The board game was a portable, space-friendly alternative which retained the visual punch of the original video.

We developed (and later fine-tuned) questions each of which alludes to one or more intersectional axes influencing the lives of individuals and created rules about moving on the board according to one’s privilege within our current social structures. The questions are revised frequently to keep them up to date. In our experience, they are sensitive to time and context. This means they might be more effective when targeted to a particular audience. The current questions focus on the academic world.

If you want to become aware of your biases, go to Project Implicit ([harvard](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html) ), a collaborative network of researchers interested in implicit social cognition. They have many different tests which might help identify implicit biases.
