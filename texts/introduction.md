Many decisions in your life brought you where you are today and will influence where you will be in the future.
<!-- Who you are today or could become tomorrow seems to be defined by the many decisions in your life so far. -->

But not all decisions are made by you. Quite some decisions are made _for_ you. 

The passive aspects that have a positive impact on your life are what constitute _privilege_. 

This game is designed to help you reflect on your privilege and the way it influences you and the people around you.
